# Example indoor VOC concentrations
Use the dataframe as an example of indoor VOC concentrations to begin R data manipulation and analysis. 

The data are totally random and not actually derived from any sampling, derived using runif() in R. Q-Q plots are also available to observe data distributions.

FYI - acet in the dataframe is acetaldehyde! Take each line as being a separate sample from a different location (ie. data are not from 'repeat visits' to one location). Dataframe includes a 'smokers_in_house' variable to indicate whether the imaginary sample was taken from an imaginary house with an imaginary smoker inside.
